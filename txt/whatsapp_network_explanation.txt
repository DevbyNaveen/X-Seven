HOW IT WORKS:

1. WHATSAPP WEB CONNECTION:
   - Evolution API connects to WhatsApp using WhatsApp Web protocol
   - This is the SAME protocol as WhatsApp Web on desktop
   - Uses Baileys library to handle the connection

2. NUMBER REGISTRATION:
   - When you scan QR code, the virtual number gets "registered" 
   - WhatsApp's servers now know this number is active
   - The number becomes discoverable on WhatsApp's global network

3. NETWORK DISCOVERY:
   - Customer searches for +1234567890 in WhatsApp
   - WhatsApp servers check their registry
   - Find the number is connected via Evolution API
   - Allow the connection between customer and business

4. MESSAGE ROUTING:
   - Customer sends message to +1234567890
   - Message goes to WhatsApp's servers
   - WhatsApp servers route it to the Evolution API instance
   - Evolution API sends webhook to your backend
   - Your AI processes and responds

KEY POINT:
Evolution API acts as a "WhatsApp Web client" that stays permanently connected.
It's like having a computer that's always logged into WhatsApp Web for each business.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Uses WebSocket connections to WhatsApp servers
- Maintains persistent sessions
- Handles encryption/decryption automatically
- Appears as a regular WhatsApp Web session to WhatsApp's network

RESULT:
- Virtual number becomes fully discoverable on WhatsApp
- Customers can find it like any other WhatsApp number
- No difference from a regular WhatsApp Business account
