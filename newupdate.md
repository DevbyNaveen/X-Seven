🌍 Global Chat AI — Agent-Orchestrated Plan

🎯 Goal

Build a global AI chat system that:

Feels natural and conversational

Uses your business data (menu, reservations, rules) via RAG

Executes actions (reservations/orders) reliably in Supabase

Streams updates live to dashboards via Supabase Realtime

Runs like modern AI SaaS platforms (Intercom, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.)

🧩 Core Components

1. Global Chat LLM (Brain)

Purpose: Central reasoning + conversation engine.

Role:

Understands user messages.

Decides which agent/tool to use.

Generates natural replies to users.

Feature:

Equipped with function schemas (reservations, orders, lookups).

Always chooses either ask user or call agent.

---

1. Intent Agent (Router)

Purpose: Decide what the user wants.

Inputs: user message.

Outputs: intent label (reservation, order, info, other).

Orchestration:

If reservation → send to Slot-Filling Agent.

If order → send to Slot-Filling Agent.

If info → send to RAG Agent.

If other → general LLM reply.

---

1. Slot-Filling Agent

Purpose: Ensure required details are collected.

Slots (example for reservations):

Name

Party size

Date/time

Contact

Orchestration:

If any slot missing → instruct LLM to ask 1 natural question.

Once all slots filled → package data into structured function call.

---

1. RAG Agent (Knowledge Agent)

Purpose: Answer questions about menu, policies, FAQs.

Process:

1. Convert query → embedding.
2. Search Supabase pgvector store for top-K documents.
3. Inject results into prompt.
4. LLM generates fact-grounded natural response.

Feature: Always cite retrieved data internally to reduce hallucination.

---

1. Execution Agent

Purpose: Perform actual actions in Supabase.

Examples:

Insert into reservations table.

Insert into orders table.

Modify/cancel reservations.

Process:

Receive structured function call from LLM.

Validate (check types, required fields).

Write to Supabase.

Trigger Supabase Realtime → dashboard update.

Send confirmation back to LLM → user.

---

1. Realtime Agent (Broadcast Layer)

Purpose: Keep dashboards live.

Powered by: Supabase Realtime.

Behavior: Any insert/update/delete triggers an event → dashboards auto-update.

No LLM needed here, purely infra.

---

⚙️ Orchestration Flow (Step by Step)

1. User → Global Chat

Message enters orchestrator.

1. Intent Detection (Intent Agent)

Decide: reservation, order, info, other.

1. If Reservation/Order → Slot-Filling Agent

Check missing fields.

If missing: LLM asks user naturally.

If complete: pass structured function call to Execution Agent.

1. If Info Request → RAG Agent

Run similarity search in Supabase vectors.

Inject results → LLM generates natural grounded response.

1. Execution (Execution Agent)

Insert/update in Supabase.

Broadcast via Realtime Agent.

Confirm back to user.

1. Loop → Conversation continues naturally.

---

✨ Features that Make It Modern

Natural Conversations: LLM still generates text; orchestration only controls actions.

Structured Actions: All backend changes happen via validated function calls.

Business Knowledge: Grounded via Supabase pgvector (RAG).

Realtime Updates: Supabase Realtime keeps dashboards synced instantly.

Scalable: Add more agents (payments, customer profile lookup, feedback collection) without breaking flow.

Auditable: Logs of LLM outputs, agent calls, and DB writes for debugging & safety.

---

📌 Example Conversation (with hidden orchestration)

User: “Book me a table tomorrow evening.”

Intent Agent → reservation.

Slot-Filling Agent sees missing party_size.

AI (natural): “Sure! How many guests will be joining you?”

User: “4 people.”

Slot-Filling Agent completes slots.

Hidden call to Execution Agent:

{"action":"create_reservation","parameters":{"name":"John","party_size":4,"datetime":"2025-09-19T19:00"}}

Execution Agent writes to Supabase → triggers Realtime → dashboard updates.

AI (natural): “All set, John! Your table for 4 is booked for tomorrow at 7pm 🎉”

---

📖 Summary

LLM = brain (talks naturally).

Agents = muscles (intent, slot-filling, retrieval, execution, realtime).

Orchestration = nervous system (decides which agent to call).

Supabase provides DB + vectors + realtime in one place.

This is how modern AI companies keep chat natural but actions reliable.
