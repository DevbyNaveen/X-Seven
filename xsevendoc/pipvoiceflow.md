🎙️ PipeCat: "Great! I've started the booking process for Giovanni's at 7 PM.
   Let me confirm the details with you..."
```

## 🔄 **Detailed Component Integration**

### **PipeCat AI's Role**
```python
# Handles real-time voice processing
voice_pipeline = Pipeline([
    TwilioTransport(),                    # Your phone integration
    STTService.elevenlabs(),             # Speech-to-text
    LLMService.openai(),                 # AI processing
    TTSService.elevenlabs(),             # Text-to-speech
])

# Connects to your existing systems
voice_pipeline.connect_to_langgraph(langgraph_instance)
voice_pipeline.connect_to_temporal(temporal_manager)
voice_pipeline.connect_to_crewai(crewai_orchestrator)
```

### **LangGraph's Role**
```python
# Manages conversation state and flow
class VoiceBookingFlow(ConversationGraph):
    def handle_voice_interruption(self):
        # Preserves context during call drops
        return saved_state
    
    def voice_context_recovery(self):
        # Recovers conversation after reconnection
        return conversation_history
```

### **Temporal's Role**
```python
# Orchestrates long-running workflows
async def booking_workflow(booking_data):
    # Step 1: Validate booking
    validation = await validate_booking(booking_data)
    
    # Step 2: Process payment
    payment = await process_payment(booking_data)
    
    # Step 3: Confirm booking
    confirmation = await confirm_booking(booking_data)
    
    # Step 4: Schedule reminders
    await schedule_reminder(booking_data)
    
    return booking_confirmation
```

### **CrewAI's Role**
```python
# Coordinates multiple agents
crew = Crew(
    agents=[
        LocationAgent(),      # Determines user location
        RestaurantAgent(),    # Finds restaurants
        BookingAgent(),       # Handles reservations
        PaymentAgent(),       # Processes payments
    ],
    process=Process.sequential
)
```

### **DSPy's Role**
```python
# Optimizes responses for voice
class VoiceResponseGenerator(dspy.Module):
    def forward(self, context):
        # Generates natural voice responses
        response = self.generate_response(context)
        # Optimizes for TTS clarity
        optimized = self.optimize_for_voice(response)
        return optimized_response
```
