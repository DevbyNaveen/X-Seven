# Universal Business Functions Transformation Plan
## From Restaurant-Specific to Multi-Category Business Platform

---

## Current Code Analysis

### What's Restaurant-Specific in Your Current Code
- **Function names:** `get_menu()`, `create_reservation()`, `process_order()`
- **Data structures:** Menu items, table availability, food orders
- **Business logic:** Restaurant hours, party sizes, meal durations
- **Terminology:** "Restaurant", "menu", "reservation", "order"

### What Needs to Become Universal
- **Dynamic service types** based on business category
- **Flexible booking systems** for different industries
- **Universal customer data** handling across all business types
- **Category-specific features** integration

---

## Transformation Strategy

## 1. Rename and Generalize Core Functions

### Current Function → Universal Function
- `find_restaurants()` → **`find_businesses()`**
- `get_menu()` → **`get_services()`**
- `check_availability()` → **`check_availability()`** (keep same)
- `create_reservation()` → **`book_service()`**
- `process_order()` → **`process_transaction()`**

## 2. Create Business Category Mapping

### Add Category Detection Logic
```
Business Categories:
- FOOD_HOSPITALITY: restaurants, cafes, bars, bakeries
- BEAUTY_PERSONAL_CARE: salons, spas, barber shops
- AUTOMOTIVE_SERVICES: repair shops, car washes, tire centers
- HEALTH_MEDICAL: clinics, dental, physiotherapy, veterinary
- LOCAL_SERVICES: cleaning, pet grooming, tutoring, repair
```

### Category-Specific Terminology
- **FOOD:** Menu items, tables, reservations, orders
- **BEAUTY:** Services, stylists, appointments, treatments
- **AUTOMOTIVE:** Services, bays, appointments, repairs
- **HEALTH:** Procedures, doctors, appointments, treatments
- **LOCAL:** Services, technicians, bookings, projects

## 3. Universal Data Structures

### Replace Restaurant-Specific Fields
- `menu_items` → **`service_offerings`**
- `table_availability` → **`resource_availability`**
- `party_size` → **`service_participants`**
- `reservation_time` → **`appointment_time`**
- `order_total` → **`service_total`**

### Add Category-Specific Fields
- **Business category** (determines available features)
- **Resource type** (tables, stylists, service bays, doctors, technicians)
- **Service duration** (meals, haircuts, oil changes, appointments, jobs)
- **Special requirements** (dietary, beauty preferences, car details, medical history, service location)

## Step-by-Step Transformation Instructions

**Resource-Specific Logic:**

### Dynamic AI Instructions
**Instead of restaurant-specific prompts, use:**
