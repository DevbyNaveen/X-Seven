## Simplified AI Backend - Usage

The simplified AI backend exposes lightweight chat and business endpoints.

### REST: Chat
- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/chat/message`
- Body:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, can I book a table?",
  "session_id": "optional-session-id",
  "context": { "business_id": 1 }
}
```
- Response:
```json
{
  "message": "...assistant reply...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "success": true,
  "metadata": { }
}
```

### WebSocket: Chat
- URL: `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/ws/{session_id}`
- Send JSON messages like:
```json
{ "message": "Show me the menu", "context": { "business_id": 1 } }
```
- Server emits events:
  - `{ "type": "connected", "message": "..." }`
  - `{ "type": "typing", "typing": true|false }`
  - `{ "type": "message_start" }`
  - `{ "type": "message_chunk", "character": "a", "position": 0 }`
  - `{ "type": "message_complete", "full_message": "..." }`

### Business Endpoints
- List active businesses: `GET /api/v1/businesses`
- Get business menu: `GET /api/v1/businesses/{business_id}/menu`

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) with:

- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Required for real AI responses via Groq
- `GROQ_MODEL` (optional): Defaults to `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite default is set; customize as needed
- `API_URL`: e.g., `http://localhost:8000`

Example (bash):
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="sk_..."
export GROQ_MODEL="llama-3.1-8b-instant"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

If `GROQ_API_KEY` is not set, the chat endpoint will return a helpful fallback message indicating AI is not configured.
